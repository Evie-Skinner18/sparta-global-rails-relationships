# Sparta Global Rails Relationships Hwk

* I found it easy to make the app and generate the different models

* I struggled to understand how the different tables have to relate to each other: attending a Code Bar helped me with this but I'm not sure I've done it quite right...

* I found it easy to integrate the three resources together using embedded Ruby links and drop down menus

* I want to improve my validations and improve the Preferences section.

* On the Preferences page, I want to make a checklist of the different cheeses available, that a user can tick according to their cheese preference.
